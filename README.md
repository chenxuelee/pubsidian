## Features
- Completely FREE
- Fully Responsive Notes.
- Graph View for Understanding Correlation BETTER and EASIER.
- Load where you left off.
- Search your note from a larger database.

## Dependency
- Only [d3.js](https://d3js.org) for generating the Graph. Apart from that, written completely in vanilla JS. No other JS library is used.

## Why this project?
- For the last couple of months, I'm using OBSIDIAN.md, a fantastic note-taking app, for tracking my studies and boosting productivity and **I LOVE IT**. But, after using for a while, yesterday, when I was about to present couple of notes to my friend, I had faced some serious challenges, publishing my notes.
- Browsing into the forum, I've come to know about Obsidian-Publish and some other alternatives. While [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) costs **8$ per month and works flawlessly** (which is btw a lot for the students like me with zero incomeðŸ˜¢), I have faced a hard time understanding its free alternatives. Also, all free alternatives lack the most interesting feature of OBSIDIAN, a.k.a the **Graph View**.
- That's why after 20+ hours of code and 6 cups of coffee, here's [my version](https://yoursamlan.github.io/pubsidian) of the free Obsidian Publish with **Graph View**ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³...

## Quick-start guide
This project is currently under development. I've added a single-click-convertor for pubsidian notes. Now, you can generate a web version of your obsidian notes just with a single script. Video tutorial is coming soon.

- STEP-1: CONVERSION:
    -  **Make sure, you have installed Python 3.5 or later.**
    -  Now, **fork and download** [yoursamlan/pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian) to your local machine.
    -  After downloading the repository, go to the ```tools``` directory.
    -  Now open command prompt/ terminal and run
        ``` pip install requirements.txt ```
    -  After installing the libraries successfully, copy ```convert2web.py``` from the tools directory to the obsidian directory, [i.e where your notes (.md) are stored.]
    -  Now open the command prompt again and run
    ``` python convert2web.py```
    -  Enter your name. It will be reflected as ```***'S NOTEBOOK``` in your pubsidian website.
    After running successfully, you'll get an ```OUTPUT``` directory, containing three elements: ```index.html```,```data.json``` and ```pages``` directory.

- STEP-2: HOSTING:
    -  Drag and drop your ```OUTPUT``` directory in [netlify]("https://app.netlify.com/drop")

Voila!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ your site is online.
